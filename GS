To set the license for GigaSpaces version 16.4.3, follow these steps:

---

### üîë Step 1: Obtain Your License Key

After downloading the commercial edition from the GigaSpaces Download Center, you should receive an email containing your license key. This key is required to activate the product.

---

### üìÑ Step 2: Apply the License

You can apply the license in one of the following ways:

#### Option 1: Edit the License File

1. Navigate to your GigaSpaces installation directory, typically referred to as `$GS_HOME`.
2. Open the `gs-license.txt` file located in the `$GS_HOME` directory with a text editor.
3. Paste your license key into a new line within the file. For example:

   ```
   Product=XAP GigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform;Version=16.4;Type=ENTERPRISE;Customer=yourname@yourcompany.com;Expiration=2025-Dec-31;Hash=PNXrPIPANOOddPNQFdQQ
   ```

#### Option 2: Set as an Environment Variable

Set the `GS_LICENSE` environment variable with your license key:

* **On Unix/Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  export GS_LICENSE="your-license-key"
  ```

* **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

  ```cmd
  set GS_LICENSE=your-license-key
  ```

* **On Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```powershell
  $env:GS_LICENSE="your-license-key"
  ```

This method is particularly useful for temporary sessions or automated scripts.

#### Option 3: Use a System Property

When starting your Java application, pass the license key as a system property:

```bash
java -Dcom.gs.licensekey="your-license-key" -jar your-application.jar
```

This approach is beneficial for embedding the license within application startup scripts.

#### Option 4: For Docker Deployments

If you're running GigaSpaces within a Docker container, pass the license key as an environment variable during container creation:

```bash
docker run -e GS_LICENSE="your-license-key" gigaspaces/xap
```

This ensures the license is set within the container environment.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify License Activation

After applying the license, start your GigaSpaces services. To confirm that the license has been correctly applied:

1. Access the GigaSpaces Management Center (GS-UI).
2. Navigate to the "Space Containers" section.
3. Select a container node in the Container Tree panel.
4. Click on the "Container Configuration" tab at the bottom of the Configuration panel.
5. Check the "License" field to ensure your license details are displayed correctly.

### üìù Additional Notes

* The evaluation license is valid for 30 days. After expiration, GigaSpaces will revert to open-source functionality upon the next restart. To continue using enterprise features, contact GigaSpaces support to purchase a commercial license.

* Avoid modifying the original `setenv` script for environment configurations. Instead, use the `setenv-overrides` script located in the `$GS_HOME/bin` directory to specify custom overrides safely.&#x20;
