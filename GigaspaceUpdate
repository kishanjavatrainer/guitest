It makes sense you‚Äôre asking this, because in GigaSpaces 16.4.x, there was a gradual shift towards more dynamic, programmatic, and container-based deployments (like via REST APIs, CLI, or directly via puInstance.deploy() calls) ‚Äî moving away from static config files like services.config.
To get rid of the services.config file in GigaSpaces 16.4.3, you have a couple of clean alternatives depending on how you're deploying services:
________________________________________
‚úÖ Options to replace services.config in GigaSpaces 16.4.3
1.	Direct Command-Line Service Deployment
Instead of using services.config with gs-agent.sh, you can start individual services like this:
gs-agent.sh gsa gsc lus gsm
You can pass JVM options and configurations directly as command-line parameters or via environment variables.
________________________________________
2.	 Programmatic Deployment via Admin API
You can deploy services and spaces programmatically without services.config using the Admin API. Example:
GigaSpace gigaSpace = new GigaSpaceConfigurer(new SpaceProxyConfigurer("mySpace")).gigaSpace();
gigaSpace.write(new MyPojo("test"));
Or deploy processing units like:
Admin admin = new AdminFactory().addLocator("localhost").createAdmin();
ProcessingUnit pu = admin.getProcessingUnits().deploy(
    new ProcessingUnitDeployment("my-processing-unit")
        .addZone("my-zone")
        .memoryCapacityPerContainer(512)
);
________________________________________
3.	Use REST Management APIs
If your services are packaged as processing units (PUs), you can deploy them via REST calls to the GigaSpaces REST Management API without using services.config.
________________________________________
4Ô∏è. Container-Based (Docker / Kubernetes)
If your environment is containerized, services and spaces can be managed via container definitions and orchestration tools (like Kubernetes YAML files, Docker Compose, or Helm charts), entirely bypassing services.config.
________________________________________
üìå Summary:
‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt need services.config to run or deploy services in 16.4.3.
‚Ä¢	Replace it with direct command-line service start, Admin API programmatic deployment, or REST-based deployment.
‚Ä¢	For modern setups, consider moving towards container orchestration for better scalability and management.
