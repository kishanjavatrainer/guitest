Let‚Äôs break this down clearly because these components are at the heart of GigaSpaces' **Service Grid architecture** (especially in classic pre-containerized deployments like GigaSpaces 16.x).

Here‚Äôs what they are:

---

## üì¶ **Core GigaSpaces Service Containers**

| **Service** | **Full Name**                     | **Role / Purpose**                                                                                      |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GSA**     | **Grid Service Agent**              | The master agent process responsible for managing and launching other services (like GSC, GSM, LUS). It acts like a node manager for your machine. |
| **GSC**     | **Grid Service Container**          | Hosts actual processing unit (PU) instances (your deployed services/spaces). Think of it like a container or JVM instance that runs your deployed apps. |
| **GSM**     | **Grid Service Manager**            | Manages and monitors the deployment of processing units across GSCs. Handles scaling, failover, redeployment, and elastic scaling logic. |
| **LUS**     | **Lookup Service**                  | Service registry for discovery. All services register themselves with one or more LUS instances so other services can discover them at runtime. |

---

## üîç **How They Work Together:**

1. **Start a GSA (Grid Service Agent)** on a machine ‚Äî it will register itself with the LUS and can start GSCs and GSMs as needed on that machine.
   
2. **GSC (Grid Service Container)** gets launched by the GSA or manually ‚Äî it provides an environment (a JVM) to host processing unit instances (your actual business apps/data grids).

3. **GSM (Grid Service Manager)** oversees deployments across all GSCs. It ensures that if you deploy a PU with 2 instances, it gets distributed and monitors their health.

4. **LUS (Lookup Service)** keeps track of what services are running and where, allowing dynamic service discovery without hardcoded addresses.

## üìà **Quick Example of Starting Them (Manually)**

```bash
gs-agent.sh gsa gsc lus gsm
```
This will start all four on your local machine.

Or start them individually:

```bash
gs-agent.sh gsa
gs-agent.sh gsc
gs-agent.sh gsm
gs-agent.sh lus
