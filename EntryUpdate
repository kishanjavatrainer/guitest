In GigaSpaces 16.4.3 and later, the use of initialLookupAttributes in the services.config file remains conceptually similar to earlier versions, but due to major internal refactoring (especially moving from legacy JavaSpaces/Jini APIs toward more modern and consistent configuration styles), some classes might be deprecated, changed in packaging, or behavior.
The key portion you're referring to is:
initialLookupAttributes =
new net.jini.core.entry.Entry[] {
    new net.jini.lookup.entry.Name("Lookup"), 
    new org.jini.rio.entry.OperationalStringEntry("Service Grid Infrastructure")
};
✅ Updated Approach for GigaSpaces 16.4.3:
You can retain this logic with minimal change — GigaSpaces 16.4.3 still supports initialLookupAttributes using the same classes, as long as the required JARs (like rio-lib, jsk-platform, etc.) are available in the classpath.
Suggested update:
1.	Make sure the following JARs are included in your classpath (these are typically found in $GS_HOME/lib/platform or similar):
o	rio-lib-<version>.jar
o	jsk-platform.jar
o	jsk-lib.jar
2.	Keep your block as-is in the services.config file (or if you are shifting to XML-based Spring-style bean config, it would need rewriting in bean form — but for services.config, this is fine):
initialLookupAttributes = new net.jini.core.entry.Entry[] {
    new net.jini.lookup.entry.Name("Lookup"),
    new org.jini.rio.entry.OperationalStringEntry("Service Grid Infrastructure")
};
3.	Ensure your RIO_HOME and GS_HOME are properly configured so the classpath includes required Rio-related classes.

⚠️ Notes on GigaSpaces 16.x Changes:
•	While much of the configuration is still backward-compatible, newer best practices encourage use of XML or programmatic configuration via Spring-style context files.
•	If you're transitioning to PU-based deployments or Spring Boot-based services, these Jini-style configurations are typically moved into either the container startup or orchestrated via admin.config.
